# DataScienceProject
This repository includes my applications which I have developed for NIST's Data Science Evaluation project.

TrafficVolumePrediction_0.5  - This project runs a simple traffic volume prediction task using openforecast library.

TrafficVolumePrediction.docx - This file contains user guide to run TrafficVolumePrediction_0.5 project with sample input file and config details provided.

TrafficVolumePrediction_TimeSeries - This project uses Weka for Time Series Analysis to forecast traffic volumes based on lag varibles (lag variables - define relation between attribute's current value and previous value). Test cases not written yet.
